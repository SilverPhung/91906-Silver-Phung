Refactor this code by separating it into individual component files. Ensure adherence to clean code practices, the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, and component-based design principles. Avoid Premature Optimization: Focus on correctness and clarity first; optimize later. Abstraction: Hide the internal complexity behind simple, well-defined interfaces that expose only what's necessary for the users or other systems.
