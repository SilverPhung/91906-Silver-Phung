When testing python code, before running the program, tell the user what their objective is for testing. Do this by modifying the instruction text in src/views/menu_view.py file to show a clear objective for testing for the player.

add print statement to track the test validation and player progression like movement or interaction etc. Keep track of all the tests and print a final message whether a test was successful, unsuccessful, or not attempted. Don't add too much loggings, it can overwhelm the logs.

Once testing is complete, and the feature is confirmed to be working well remove the debug testing for a clean code.
